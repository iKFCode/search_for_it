search_for_it module consists of two functions: naive search function and binary search function, and here is how they work:


Naive Search Function
This is a Python function that performs a naive search to find a target value in a given list.

Usage
-----
The function can be used by calling it and passing in two arguments:
  naive_search(lst, target)
where:
  - lst: the list to search in
  - target: the target value to find in the list
The function returns the index of the target value in the list if it is found, or -1 if it is not found.

Examples
--------
Here are some examples of how to use the naive_search function:
1. Searching for a value in a list:
lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 5
index = naive_search(lst, target)
print(index) # Output: 2
2. Searching for a value that is not in the list:
lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 4
index = naive_search(lst, target)
print(index) # Output: -1

Notes
-----
This function is a simple implementation of a search algorithm and may not be the most efficient option for very large lists. For larger or more complex problems, more optimized algorithms such as binary search or hash table lookup may be more appropriate.


"Binary Search Function"
This function implements a binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted list of integers.

Usage
To use the function, simply call it with two arguments: a sorted list of integers and a target value to search for. The function will return the index of the target value in the list, or -1 if the value is not found.

Here's an example usage:
my_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
target = 8
result = binary_search(my_list, target)
print(result)   # Output: 3
In this example, the binary_search function is called with a sorted list of integers [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14] and a target value of 8. The function returns the index of 8 in the list, which is 3.

Function Definition
Here's the definition of the binary_search function:
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """Searches for a target value in a sorted list using binary search.

    Args:
        arr (list): A sorted list of integers.
        target (int): The target value to search for in the list.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target value in the list, or -1 if the target value is not found.

    """
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return -1
